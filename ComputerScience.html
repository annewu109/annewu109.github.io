		<h2>Apps for Good</h2>
		<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
			<p>People who have type 1 diabetes don't have an simple and effective way of tracking the 
			amount of carbohydrates they've consumed in a meal. This information is important for
			their daily lives because the amount of carbohydrates they've eaten dictates how much insulin 
			they have to administer to themselves. This is especially a concern when they
			are eating out at a restaurant, since nutrition information isn't as readily accessible.
			</p>
		<h3> Intended Audience </h3> 
			<p>This app is intended to be used by those have Type 1 Diabetes. Since type 1 diabetics are often
			diagnosed at a young age, we wanted our app to be easy to use and accessible for people of all 
			ages.</p>
		<h3> Solution </h3>
		<p>With Marlon Jost and Lily Pattison, we created CarbSmart, an app that makes tracking carbohydrates
		for a meal easier than ever. First, the user is prompted to enter the max grams of carbs they want to 
		consume for their current meal.
		From there, the app mainly functions utilizing search queries to a cloud storage service
		called Firebase. The user first searches what restaurant the user wants to search orders for. After that,
		the user is free to add orders from that restaurant into a meal. As orders are added, the app is able to
		automatically calculate how many carbs are in their desired meal and compare that value to their
		desired max carbs.</p>
