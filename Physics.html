		<h1>Physics</h1>
		
		<p>Advanced Physics is a class taught by Maureen Chase. It is a rigorous course that teaches content sufficient 
		for AP Physics exams. I already had some basic physics knowledge before I took this course, so this course
		helped me to further expand that knowledge. The curriculum also utilizes some calculus concepts. Though my knowledge 
		in calculus was minimal when I started going to Mass Academy, this course provides enough information to 
		apply those concepts in a Physics context. </p>
		
		<h2>Momentum Investigations</h2>
		
		<p>This is an in-class project that I worked on with <a href="https://users.wpi.edu/~akelley4/">Anya Kelley</a>, <a href="https://users.wpi.edu/~jli18/">Jaylin Li</a>, and <a href="https://users.wpi.edu/~jyu10/">Joseph Yu</a>. The goal of this project was
		to understand how the momentum of objects are affected by factors like velocity and mass. We used our prior knowledge 
		of the subject we learned in class and applied it to hands-on experimentation using two carts with built in motion
		sensors. We were also given the opportunity to learn more about the features in Vernier Graphical AnalysisÂ®.</p>

		<h2>Dynamics Lab</h2>
		
		<p>For this project, we were required to make an experiment that tested a hypothesis related to dynamics in a group and 
		then individually create an info sheet showing the steps and conclusions from that experiment. My group, which included <a href="https://users.wpi.edu/~achen5/">Amy Chen</a>, <a href="https://users.wpi.edu/~ewang1/">Emily Wang</a>, and me,
		decided to find if the friction on an object changed depending on the angle of the surface it is sliding on. We found 
		that the coefficient of friction between the block and the board didn't change. However, the larger the angle of the
		board, the lower the frictional force of the block. One challenge I came across while trying to present this information
		was keeping all of it contained within one page. The opportunity to create our own experiment based on the course content
		was a nice change of pace.</p>
