		<h1>Community Service</h1> 
		
		<p>Community service is a relatively recent endeavor for me, since I just started in high school.
		That being said, I felt it has been a worthwhile experience. Being able to help people in the communities that you're in
		is quite fulfilling. In the past, I have assisted others by doing individual tutoring online, 
		helping to teach a group of students the basics of programming, and proctoring math competitions.
		Below is some of the community service I currently take part in.</p>

		<h2>Community Servings</h2>
		
		<p><a href="https://www.servings.org/" target="_blank">Community Servings</a> is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that is dedicated 
		to preparing and providing healthy food to those with chronic illnesses. Usually I do meal packaging, 
		though I have prepared some food as well. I think Community Servings contributes to a great cause. 
		All of the staff is welcoming and I always enjoy volunteering there.
