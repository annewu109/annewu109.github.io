		<h1>STEM II</h1>
		
		<p>STEM II is a class taught by Kevin Crowthers. In the second semester, students are tasked to create 
		assistive devices for local clients in need in groups. I worked with Chengwei Wang, Jaylin Li, and Thomas Park 
		to create an caretaker alert device for a care home in Seven Hills.</p>
		
		<h1>HomeAlert</h1>
		
		<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
		
		<p>For many visually impaired persons (VIPs), a caretaker is needed to help them perform simple daily tasks, such as pouring water 
		into a cup. However, the caretaker will not always be beside the VIP. In order to solve this problem, an assistive button-to-alarm 
		system will be constructed to help alert the caretaker that the patient needs assistance. When VIPs are learning to integrate their 
		disability into their normal life, a caretaker is required to complete their VIPs' simple daily tasks and slowly teach them how to 
		perform these tasks without assistance. A caretaker may need to tend to the needs of multiple patients, so a patient may not always 
		stay in contact with their caretaker. Therefore, when patients need assistance, they have no method of contacting their caretakers. 
		Additionally, this creates the risk that the caretaker may not be aware when a patient is in need of emergency assistance, so a 
		solution is needed.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Project Goal</h2>
		<p>Build a system that allows for communication between a VIP patient and caretaker via button and speaker devices.</p>
		
		<h2>Design Approach</h2>
		
		<p>This alarm system consists of two small devices: a patient button device and a caretaker alarm device. 
		The patient device consists of two buttons connected to an Arduino system that is wirelessly connected to the caretaker 
		device Arduino system through a pair of transceivers. On the caretaker device, a speaker is connected to the arduino system 
		to produce different sounds based on the button pressed on the patient device. On the patient device, one button has a round surface, 
		and the other has a triangle shape on the surface. The round surface button is pressed for non-emergency assistance, and the button with 
		a triangle shape is pressed for emergency assistance. Additionally, for each patient device, the alarm sound is different from one another.
