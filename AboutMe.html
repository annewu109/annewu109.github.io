		<h1>About Me</h1>
		
		<p>Hello, visitors! My name is Anne Wu and I am currently a college freshman at Tufts University. My family consists of my dad, mom, and older sister, who is currently in her senior year of college.
		 Before Tufts, I attended the Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science (MAMS), a magnet school that is associated with Worcester Polytechnic Insitute. 
		  I’ve always been an active problem solver and can quickly adapt to new environments and concepts. 
		  I have a particular interest in STEM topics, developing an interest in mathematics and Computer Science
		   early on in my life.</p>
		   
		<p>In many of the schools I’ve been in, I’ve been an active member of that school’s math team.
		 I have taken part in many math competitions, like <a href="https://www.mathcounts.org/" target="_blank">MATHCOUNTS</a>, 
		 <a href="https://www.maa.org/math-competitions" target="_blank">AMC</a>, 
		 and <a href="https://mathkangaroo.org/mks/" target="_blank">Math Kangaroo</a>. 
		 Math competitions in particular use the skills you have and put them all together to solve a particular problem. 
		 In other words, it's the perfect exercise in problem solving.</p>

		 <p>In addition, I have also been an active participant of my school's programming and computer clubs, and I have also participated in 
			some computer competitions. For example, I have participated in USACO and am currently in the silver division. I have also participated 
			in MIT Blueprint 2023, which me and a group of other participants tried to create an time management application.
		 </p>
		 
		<p> Though I work hard on my academics, not everything I do is work. 
		 I have a few hobbies I engage in as well, like singing, and visual art.</p>
		 
		<h2>Singing</h2>
		<p>Before I started to take singing classes, I always enjoyed trying to sing the songs my parents would always listen to. 
		When I was around 3rd or 4th grade, I started to take singing lessons and participate in choir. I currently attend voice 
		lessons every week. One of the choirs I participated in was the 
		<a href="https://worcesterchildrenschorus.org/" target="_blank">Worcester Children's Chorus</a>. 
		One of the performances I was a part of is shown below! </p>

		<p>I have also taken part in the Royal Conservatory Examinations for Voice. Most recently, I have earned
			First Class Honors on Voice Level 8. I am also a 3-time member of the MMEA District Choirs.
		</p>
		 
		<h2>Visual Art</h2>
		<p>When I have free time, I enjoy drawing! I had started to develop my passion for drawing when I was in elementary school 
		and have stayed passion ever since. I've always been inspired by the other artists around me as well as the art in the 
		video games or shows that I enjoy. I often like drawing my favorite characters from these media, though I have been expanding 
		my horizons as of late. I currently attend art lessons, mainly studying still lifes and digital art.</p>
