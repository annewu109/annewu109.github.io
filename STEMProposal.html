		<h1>Detecting Fake News Using a Machine Learning Model Based on Lexical Characteristics of Text</h1>
		
		<p>This work is important because it expands on previous research on the usage of vocabulary in fake and real news,
		as well as automated fake news detection in general. Current research in the field often combines the method of using 
		LIWC or lexical qualities in general with other methods. It is important to understand how the method of analyzing
		lexical qualities with machine learning performs by itself before we expand its usage to other applications.</p>
