    <p>During the game, you will be presented with 5 buttons, each of which will play a note. The computer will play a sequence of these buttons. 
        You will have to press the buttons in that order in order to earn a point. The sequences will become longer the more you play.
        Once you miss one of these sequences, the game is over.</p>
